## Project Topic
This project describes a model used to predict admission chances

## Dataset Description
 I used a function to load my dataset. it is a dataframe with  400 entries, 0 to 399
 anda total 9 of  columns

## Techniques
In this project, I leveraged on data cleaning techniques to check for missing data and used the standard scaler to scale my data. I used a function to do a test_train_split

## Model Development
In thius project I developed four models which includes:

- Linear Regressor	
-	AdaBoost Regressor		
-	Support Vector Machines (SVM)		
-	XGBoost Regressor

The support vector model gave the best results after running some metrics on it such as the mean squared error, root_mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error ,mean_absolute_percentage_error and The cofficient_of_determination(r2)

## Conclusion
I developed a user interface to allow external usage of the model. I used gradio and i used a function to achieve this
